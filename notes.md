# Slide 3

A long story short.  
Our frontend journey began with simple Vue prototype and rich Quasar components library. As the project progressed and grew, we began to notice how difficult it was to keep the project clean and tidy. We have had problems with SSR, memory leaks on a server side, performance score issues. That's why our team decided to go in more traditional way - use template engine.
